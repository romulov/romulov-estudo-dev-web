    <p>Eyes are <span style="background-color: gray;">organs of the visual system</span>. They provide living organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision. Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons.</p>
